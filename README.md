# AASbyLLM

The web-application is hosted here: https://aasbyllmapp-v15-1-yawjvp4zbq-ew.a.run.app/ 
(Note: It takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes for the elastic server system to boot up.)

# The Main Features of 'AASbyLLM' and Its Novel Contributions:
### Technologies:
- First research prototype applying **generative LLM** for generating AAS
- Apply generative LLMs for **inferencing** and embedding LLMs for **similarity retrieval**

### Benefits:
- Wider range of **input flexibility** and format independent, as long as the meaning of text input is understandable
- **Generally applicable** to different disciplinary domains.
- Instead of using manually crafted mapping rules, the system utilizes the knowledge learned by LLMs
- The system adds proper **semantic annotation** for disambiguating the **concepts of the data property**
- The system optimizes relevant information details during the processing and enhances the quality of AAS 

### Implications:
- This prototype demonstrates the machine capability to **semantically understand and generate data properties for industrial applications**.
- This capability can enable:
  1. an **interoperable** information exchange in the context of **digitalization**
  2. and higher degree of **task automation** in the context of **autonomization**
