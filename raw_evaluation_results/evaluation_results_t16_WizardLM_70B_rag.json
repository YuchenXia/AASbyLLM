IP addresses for participation in the internet are assigned by the NIC's because they must be unique worldwide. The assignment takes place in certain network classes depending on the size of the company. The interpretation of the IP address is determined by network masks. Not all addresses (i.e. not all combinations of four integers 0-255) may be used. Many are reserved for special functions.
