In most cases it can be determined via the parameterization whether the input is activated by applying a HIGH or a LOW level. Common functions of the input are e.g. B. Laser-off, trigger function or synchronization. The function can also be dependent on the duration of the applied signal. E.g. with external teach-in of two distance values \u200b\u200bfor the min./max. Value scaling of the analog output",
