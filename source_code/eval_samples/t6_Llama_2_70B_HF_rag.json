These integers identify the network and subnetworks as well as the computer itself. The IP addresses are generally only used internally. On the user interface, names in clear text are generally used instead. The assignment of names to addresses is carried out by a DNS. IP addresses for participation in the internet are assigned by the NIC's because they must be unique worldwide. The assignment takes place in certain network classes depending on the size of the company. The interpretation of the IP address is determined by network masks. Not all addresses (i.e. not all combinations of four integers 0-255) may be used. Many are reserved for special functions. Since with the boom in the use of the internet the number of available IP addresses will become insufficient, new IP protocols (IPv6) are under development. These use addresses with 16 bytes",
